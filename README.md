# NI Tech & Design Slack Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct belongs to the NI Tech & Design Slack ("The Slack") -- a tech- and design-focussed Slack group loosely geographically based around Northern Ireland. The Code of Conduct is currently being maintained in the file `code-of-conduct.md` in https://github.com/nitechdesign/code-of-conduct/ ("This Repository")


## Proposing Changes

Changes can be proposed by any member of The Slack, and are accepted through the following mechanisms:

At present, "anonymous" changes are accepted -- this is subject to change if the quality of anonymous changes degrades.
